# https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/issues/8499 - Known issue, pre-compiled wheels
# Use specific compatible version for python 3.9/3.10 to bypass audioop issues
# (This is an example URL for discord.py from source - not a direct fix for audioop, but often used to fix tricky builds)
# We need a proper wheel if available that is NOT python 3.13
# As Discord.py version 2.4.0 claims python 3.10 is compatible but the error is persisting,
# The ultimate solution is typically to remove the 'discord-py' voice requirement from dependencies (but impossible if its hardcoded within discord.py itself).
# We also cannot remove audioop from the `site-packages` as we don't have super user access           # Discord API wrapper for your bot
Flask==2.3.2                # Web framework for your backend server
Flask-SocketIO==5.3.6       # Adds Socket.IO support to Flask for real-time communication
python-dotenv==1.0.0        # Used to load environment variables from the .env file
requests==2.31.0            # Used by your bot.py to make HTTP requests to the Flask backend
Flask-Cors==4.0.0           # Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for Flask. Crucial for GitHub Pages to talk to your Render backend.
gunicorn==22.0.0            # A WSGI HTTP server, used to run Flask apps in production on Render.
gevent-websocket==0.10.1    # Required by Gunicorn to efficiently handle WebSockets with Flask-SocketIO.
