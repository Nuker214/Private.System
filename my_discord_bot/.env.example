# The PUBLICly accessible URL of your Flask backend server (app.py).
# This is where your GitHub Pages index.html will connect via Socket.IO,

# Example: https://my-system-relay-as12d34.onrender.com

# The URL where your Whitelist.json file is hosted and accessible.
# Since your frontend is GitHub Pages and backend is Render, the backend needs to fetch this.
# RECOMMENDED: Host it via your Render backend. Once deployed, it would be:
# "YOUR_RENDER_SERVICE_PUBLIC_URL/website/Whitelist.json"
# (e.g., "https://my-system-relay-as12d34.onrender.com/website/Whitelist.json")
# Alternatively, you could use the raw GitHub link:
# "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourRepoName/main/website/Whitelist.json"
