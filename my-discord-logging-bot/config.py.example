# Instead, copy the contents into your actual config.py (which should be in .gitignore if storing secrets directly),
# or BETTER YET, use ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES on your hosting platform for deployment.
# This file serves as a reference for required variables.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# --- Discord Bot Configuration ---
# Your Discord Bot Token:
# Get this from Discord Developer Portal -> Your Application -> Bot -> Token -> "Reset Token"
# SET THIS AS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE named "DISCORD_TOKEN" on your hosting platform.
DISCORD_TOKEN = "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"

# Bot's Command Prefix (e.g., '!', '.', '?'):
# SET THIS AS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE named "COMMAND_PREFIX". Defaults to '.' if not set.
COMMAND_PREFIX = "."

# --- Discord Channel IDs ---
# These are your specific Discord Channel IDs for the bot to interact with.
# To get a Channel ID: Enable Discord Developer Mode (User Settings -> Advanced),
# then right-click on the desired channel -> "Copy ID".
# SET THESE AS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES on your hosting platform (e.g., Render.com).
# For example, for 'WEBSITE_CHANNEL_ID', you would create an environment variable with
# KEY = "WEBSITE_CHANNEL_ID" and VALUE = "1409339938427637811".

WEBSITE_CHANNEL_ID    = 1409339938427637811 # Channel for 'System Is Now Online' announcements (from the bot when it starts up)
LOGIN_CHANNEL_ID      = 1409340483255144608 # Channel for '(user) Has Been Connected' announcements (if triggered by your website)
DISCONNECTED_CHANNEL_ID = 1409350070326792293 # Channel for '(user) Has Been Disconnected' announcements (if triggered by your website), AND for bot's own disconnection status.
LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID    = 1409340101825265704 # Channel for general bot operational logs and command invocations
ERROR_CHANNEL_ID      = 1409349720928948244 # Channel for reporting critical errors and unhandled exceptions

# --- Discord Role ID for Admin Commands (Optional) ---
# If you want certain commands to be admin-only:
# To get a Role ID: Right-click on your admin role in Discord -> "Copy ID".
# If you don't need admin roles, leave it as None in your environment.
# SET THIS AS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE named "ADMIN_ROLE_ID".
ADMIN_ROLE_ID = None # Example: 112233445566778899 (Your actual Admin Role ID)

# --- Your Website API Configuration ---
# This is the base URL for your *deployed* website's backend API.
# Your Discord bot will send requests to this URL for most commands (e.g., fetching user data, executing actions).
# Make sure this is the PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE URL of your backend.
# SET THIS AS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE named "WEBSITE_API_BASE_URL".
WEBSITE_API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000/api" # CHANGE THIS to your actual deployed website API base URL!

# --- Debugging (for local use only, should not be active in production) ---
# Set this to "True" for verbose local debugging, "False" for production.
# SET THIS AS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE named "DEBUG_MODE".
DEBUG_MODE = "False"
