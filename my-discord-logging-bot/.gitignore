# Discord Bot specific - local configuration (keep your actual config.py OUT of repo)
# However, for using os.getenv, config.py is needed in repo.
# So, for local dev, if you create a .env file to store local variables, you would ignore that:
.env

# If you were to store tokens directly in a config.py locally, you'd ignore it,
# but with os.getenv, the config.py is fine to be in the repo.
# DO NOT add config.py here if you're using os.getenv; it needs to be available for deployment.
# Only add if you ever put sensitive info directly into config.py locally
# config.py
